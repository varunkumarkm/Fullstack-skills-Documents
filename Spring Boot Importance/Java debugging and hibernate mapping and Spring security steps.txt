Debugging:

step 1: we understand a where the program is starting, and how can we run a program
step 2: add a breakpoint of that line and Run a program as a debugging mode

There are three important features in debugging are:
1) step over    2) step into    3) step return

1) step over: step over is helps us to moving a one line ahead
2) step into: step into is used when we want to go to that method
   then again we click a step over, its gone again go through next further
3) step return: step return is used to going back


Hibernate mapping:

What is lazy loading and eager loading?
Lazy loading  -> When the user can access the only one entity, then we can use lazy, because it will give us a better performance
eager loading -> When the user can access the all the entities, But performance is not good

What is cascade?
It means when we modified something in the parent we remove the parent row the cascade type should remove all the data from child, 
which means any modified is done the parent, it will always impact in the child
 
what is the meaning of orphanRemoval = true?
it means when the delete the parent and child will orphan, when the parent is removed automatically child will also removed
